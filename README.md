# Interactive-Health-Survival-Dashboard
This interactive Health Survival Dashboard analyzes patient survival by conditions like anemia, diabetes, and smoking. Users can filter by gender and explore survival by age, creatinine, ejection fraction, and other factors, revealing how these impact survival outcomes. It offers a clear view of health factors affecting patient survival.
An Overview of this dashboard: This Health Survival Dashboard provides an interactive analysis of patient survival based on various health conditions and factors. I designed this dashboard in Tableau, allowing users to filter survival data by gender (male, female, or all) for a customized view. It explores survival rates among 299 individuals, with 96 recorded deaths. Interactive pie charts display survival status for conditions such as anemia, high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, and sex, revealing that negative test results generally correlate with higher survival rates. The bar charts dynamically show survival by age, creatinine, serum sodium, ejection fraction, platelets, and creatinine phosphokinase, with color-coded survival status. A scatter plot illustrates the relationship between age and survival time, with the ability to filter by gender. This dashboard provides a clear, interactive view of how different factors impact survival, making it a valuable tool for exploring patient outcomes.
The main insight from this Health Survival Dashboard is that negative test results (absence of conditions like anemia, high blood pressure, smoking, and diabetes) are generally associated with higher survival rates. Age significantly impacts survival, with younger patients having higher survival rates. Higher ejection fraction values (a measure of heart function) are associated with better survival outcomes, while high creatinine levels (indicating kidney function) are linked to lower survival. The dashboard also shows that survival rates differ by gender, with females having a slightly higher survival rate than males. These insights can help identify key health factors affecting patient survival.
